# Discord-data-viewer-program
This program allows you to easily view discord package folder that you get when you request your data on discord. It allows you to check who you messaged and what messages you've sent.

<b>!Important update from 18th January 2025.!</b> I realized that discord seems to have changed how the package folder works, I updated only the first main function of the program, because the other two are now easily replacable with discords search bar or /msg command. While I understand that this isn't a perfect solution especially if you cannot access your account. The function that isn't available on discord works now, so there's that. The previous version of the program still works fine if you're working with older packages, however new ones won't work, sorry for the inconvenience! <b>Use version 2 for newer data, or the original version for older packages.</b>

There have been multiple updates been made to the program and I will continue work on it later tomorrow! Please look at DiscordDataViewerBeta.py for the improved version of the app!
