# Discord-data-viewer-program
This program allows you to easily view discord package folder that you get when you request your data on discord. It allows you to check who you messaged and what messages you've sent.

4th of April 2024:
There have been multiple updates been made to the program and I will continue work on it later tomorrow! Please look at DiscordDataViewerBeta.py for the improved version of the app!
